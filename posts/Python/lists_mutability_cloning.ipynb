Also, I found on the internet the sentences \"variables are names associated with concrete objects\" or \"variable is essentially a name that is assigned to a value\". No, that's incorrect. A variable is a name (in a namespace) of a *pointer*. And that pointer points to a location in memory where an object can be found. That object has then a value (along with a type and an identity). But a namespace isn't the only place we can found pointers."
